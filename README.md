Dont read me :-
1. java script functions are hoisted as they can be accessed before declaring . if a function is called first then it is declared it will give results after that too 

2. function expressions are not hoisted 

3. javascript not need semicolon , js engine provide a auto assignment of semicolon during runtime 

4. jb app ek function ko dusre function me as a parameter pass krte ho toh usko hmlog bolte hai call back function.

5. Synchronous:- code will run line by line will follow a order in sync 


6. Asynchronous:- code will not run in order ,setTimeout(() => { } is an asynchronous function .

7. Nested callback functions are called call back hell 

8. To avoid  call back hell we use promises
